## 📊 Detection Rules

### 🔎 Splunk – Failed Login Detection

```spl
index=windows EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name, src_ip
| where count > 5
```

### 🔎 Elastic (KQL) – Suspicious Process

```kql
process.name : "powershell.exe" and process.command_line : "*-enc*"
```

### 🔎 Sigma – PowerShell Abuse

```yaml
title: Suspicious PowerShell Execution
logsource:
  product: windows
  service: security
selection:
  CommandLine|contains: "-enc"
condition: selection
level: medium
```
